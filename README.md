# Halo Fullstack Coding Challenge 2018

Part 1 - Backend: write a Python Flask microservice that has two API methods: “get” and “set”.  The method “get” takes a “key” argument and returns the current value associated with the key, if it exists.  The method “set” takes two arguments, a “key” and a “value”, and sets the value of “key” to the specified value.  The data should be persisted to a database using sqlalchemy.

Part 2 - Frontend: design and code a front end for the above key/value API service.  Users should be able to load an HTML page and get/set keys.  Use HTML, CSS, and Javascript/JQuery as necessary.

Part 3 - Advanced: add a user model to the above service.  A user should be able to sign up, log in, and log out.  While logged in, they should only be able to interact with and modify keys they have created - do not allow users to see or modify another users key/value pairs.  Logged out users should not be able to do anything other than elog in.”
